THE DIGITAL UNIVERSITY OPEN SOURCE CODE

We provide the complete code of a simple and very efficient framework 
that can be employed by organizations to develop their own knowledge graph, 
offering a comprehensive picture of the strategic data of the organization, 
such that it can be consistently exploited by different digital services.
It is released as an Eclipse Java project.

It supports data engineers in the creation of a multilingual knowledge graph 
that is built from data extracted from multiple sources by means of ETL facilities. 
In terms of complexity the entity matching and integration algorithm is linear 
in the number of entities to be integrated, i.e. it is O(n). 
It makes use of very efficient data structures (hash tables) and runs entirely on RAM memory.
